### Alexander Beck

Welcome to my GitHub profile. My name is Beck and I am a software developer. I share most of my code here on GitHub for all to see and to show my improvement over time. If you would like to contact me, email me at beckhv2@gmail.com. I am looking to collaborate on any programming project that I can and I am also interested in work opportunities. Unfortunately, while I am finishing up my current contract, I only have 10-15 hours per week to put into projects or software development. After my contract, I will be looking for full time work.
